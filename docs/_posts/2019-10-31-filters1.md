I just posted a new Examples Notebook called `filters_1` that reproduces the NCL example. It's a simple weighted rolling average. NCL has a nice function that does this. In the notebook I show several ways to produce the same answer with either xarray or numpy methods.

The result is the same as NCL. Here are the results. First NCL's plot looks like

and using Matplotlib (without worrying about titles etc.):
