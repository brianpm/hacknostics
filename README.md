# hacknostics

Some atmospheric diagnostics, focused on analysis of CESM.

The repo is organized into Notebooks, utilities (`util`), and notes (`docs`). 

## Notebooks

Example applications are shown in these Notebooks.

- `vertical_cross_section_example` shows how to make a vertical cross section on pressure levels.
- `dev_metadata_decorator` is in development, but shows how one might design a decorator to a function that will preserve metadata.

## util

The `util` directory contains `.py` files that have useful functions or provide command line interfaces. See the README in that directory for detailed descriptions.
